## Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter an problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue. If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too." Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

* The version of Xcode you're using
* The version of iOS or macOS you're targeting
* The full output of any stack trace or compiler error
* A code snippet that reproduces the described behavior, if applicable
* Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem
* This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Lingo](https://github.com/Mobelux/Lingo/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done. When you send a pull request please refrence the issue # for the bug/feature you are adding. If it's a breaking change, consider opening an issue about it first so we can have a quick discussion about it before you implement it. 

### Tests
Adding tests is a great thing, and will greatly improve the project. Please try to add tests around all bug fixes or feature changes.

### Commits

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
